# You can enter as many threads to stimulate a load test. A single user is represented by each Thread. So if you wish
# to simulate a load test with 5 concurrent users then you need to enter 5 as the value for this property. A high end
# machine will be able to spawn more number of threads. To keep the consistent(or nearly consistent) gap between the
# threads, adjust this number with 'ramp.up.period.in.seconds' and the actual response time of the API end point.
# For "@RunWith(ZeroCodeMultiLoadRunner.class)", set this to at least equal to number of "@TestMapping" or more,
# otherwise there wont be enough threads to run each test.
number.of.threads=3

# It indicates the time taken to create all of the threads needed to fork the requests. If you set 10 seconds as the
# ramp-up period for 5 threads then the framework will take  10 seconds to create those 5 threads, i.e. each thread
# will be at work appx 2 secs gap between the requests. Also by setting its value to 0 all the threads can be created
# at once at the same time. Note- If you want to fire more threads/user-requests in less ramp up time e.g. 5 threads
# in 2secs(or 5 threads in 1 sec), then, use '@UseHttpClient(SslTrustHttpClient.class)' as this closes the connection
# before making the next connection.
ramp.up.period.in.seconds=3

# By specifying its value framework gets to know that how many times the test(s), i.e. the number of requests will be
# repeated per every 'ramp.up.period.in.seconds'.
# Supposing number.of.threads = x, ramp.up.period.in.seconds = y, loop.count = i
# then (x * i) = number of requests will be fired over (y * i) seconds. If x=5, i=3, y=20, then 15 requests will be
# fired in 60 seconds which means- every request in 4 seconds gap. 60/15 or 20/5 = 4seconds.
loop.count=1

# If you have set the loop count to a higher digit which e.g. should take 3hrs(3*60*60=10800sec),
# but due to load or network delay it could take more time(you are speculating) e.g. 4hrs, then you can
# set this abort value to 3hrs i.e. 3*60*60=10800sec.
